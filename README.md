Sudoku solving python script

This is just a small project to bolster my Python skills and practice coding in general.
The goal is to continue adding features to practice different skillsets such as algorithms, GUI interfaces, game development etc...

Roadmap:

- [X] Backtracking algorithm to check validity and solve a hard coded Sudoku problem.
- [ ] Create an randomized Sudoku problem generator that can ensure it is valid and has a solution.
- [ ] Create a GUI that will visualize the backtracking algorithm for the user.
- [ ] Figure out how to make the GUI interactable and be able to play Sudoku.
